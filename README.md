# minimize-the-maximum-of-two-arrays
We have two arrays arr1 and arr2 which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:  arr1 contains uniqueCnt1 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by divisor1. arr2 contains uniqueCnt2 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by 2.
